# SysVerilog_game_DonkeyKong
Here you'll find the game "Donkey Kong" written 100% in SysVerilog. You'll need an FPGA card, a screen, a keypad, and a speaker for the full experience.

You can ping me at arnold.cheskis@gmail.com for more info and instructions on rerunning it. I do not guarantee I will remember everything, but I will help u find the answers :)
